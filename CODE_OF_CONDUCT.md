## 6. Acknowledgements 🙏

This Code of Conduct is inspired by common open source community guidelines and
similar documents used across many projects. It is intentionally short and
focused on practicality for a small C library like **libmemalloc**.

If you have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue or pull request
in the repository.
