# REUSE.toml — Licensing metadata for libmemalloc
#
# This file follows the REUSE Specification:
#   https://reuse.software/spec/
#
# Goal:
#   - Declare that the main libmemalloc code is licensed under MIT.
#   - Cover typical source / build infrastructure files.
#   - You can override or refine this later for docs, examples or
#     third-party code.
#
# Notes:
#   - "version" refers to the REUSE.toml schema version (currently 1).
#   - Each [[annotations]] block associates license info with one or
#     more paths (files or globs) relative to the repository root.
#   - Additional annotations can be added for files with different
#     licenses (e.g. third_party/, docs/, assets/, etc.).
